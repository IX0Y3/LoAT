===== available solvers =====

This Docker container allows you to run the following solvers:

* loat     -- LoAT's implementation of Acceleration Driven Clause Learning
* bmc      -- Z3's implementation of bounded model checking
* spacer   -- Z3's implementation of the Spacer algorithm
* eld      -- Eldarica's default configuration
* tpa      -- Golem's implementation of Transition Power Abstraction
* eld-stac -- Eldarica with acceleration as pre-processing


===== available benchmarks =====

This Docker container provides the following collections of benchmarks:

* lia-lin-int -- the benchmarks from the CHC-Comp category LIA-Lin *without*
  - benchmarks using the operators div or mod and
  - benchmarks using variables of type Bool
* lia-lin     -- the benchmarks from the CHC-Comp category LIA-Lin *without*
  - benchmarks using the operators div or mod and

The benchmarks are located in the directory /examples/lia-lin[-int].


===== running a single benchmark =====

You can run a single solver on a single benchmark via

run_$solver $benchmark $timeout.

For example,

run_loat /examples/lia-lin-int/chc-LIA-Lin_052.smt2 1

runs LoAT on the leading example from our paper with a timeout of one second. If
the timeout is omitted, then it defaults to 300.


===== getting LoAT's proofs =====

To see the proof produced by LoAT, you can run

run_loat_proofs $benchmark $timeout.

For example, you can run

run_loat_proofs /examples/lia-lin-int/chc-LIA-Lin_052.smt2 1

to see LoAT's proof for the leading example from our paper. If the timeout is
omitted, then it defaults to 300.

By default, LoAT's proofs are colored to make them more readable. However, this
is disadvantageous if you want to write a proof to a file or inspect it with,
e.g., 'less', as the colors are not displayed correctly in these cases. To get
uncolored proofs, you can run

run_loat_proofs_plain $benchmark $timeout.

For example, you can run

run_loat_proofs_plain /examples/lia-lin-int/chc-LIA-Lin_052.smt2 1

to see LoAT's proof for the leading example from our paper without colors.


===== running a benchmark collection =====

You can run a single solver on one of the provided collections of benchmarks via

run_all $solver $benchmark_collection $timeout.

For example,

run_all loat lia-lin-int 1

runs LoAT on all examples from the benchmark collection lia-lin-int with a
timeout of one second. If the timeout is omitted, then it defaults to 300.

When run_all finishes, it provides the number of instances where sat or unsat
was proven. For examples, on my machine the command above finishes with:

unsat: 30
sat: 0
unknown: 179

Of course, you might get slightly different results, depending on the machine
that you are using.


===== custom benchmarks =====

Of course, you can also run the tools on custom benchmarks. To write them, the
following editors are pre-installed in the Docker container:

* emacs
* vim
* nano
