 *
 * E.g. "x^2 + y > 5" with update "y := a*b" becomes "x2 + y > 5" and "y := ab",
 * where "x2" and "ab" are fresh variables.
 *
 * Note that substituting an expression like "x^2" or "a*b" is only possible if
 * the variables (x,a,b) are not updated and do not occur in any other expressions.
 * E.g. "x^2 < x^3" cannot be substituted to "x2 < x3"
 * (since this would lose the relation between x2 and x3).
 *
 * Note that we do not care about the rule's cost, since linearization is only
 * a temporary step to make Farkas lemma applicable when finding metering functions.
