 * Class to encapsulate the process of finding a metering function for a given transition using z3 and Farkas lemma
 *
 * Central constraints for the metering function f (G is guard, U is update, x the variables)
 *  (1)  (not G)   implies  f(x) <= 0
 *  (2)   G        implies  f(x) >= 1 (equivalent to f(x) > 0 on integers)
 *  (3)  (G and U) implies  f(x) <= f(x') + 1
 *
 * The search is performed by constructing a linear template f(x) = c*x + c0,
 * where x are variables (only those we consider relevant for the metering function)
 * and c are the corresponding coefficients (c0 is the absolute coefficient).
 * The values for c and c0 are determined by a z3 query, such that constraints (1)-(3) are satisfied.
