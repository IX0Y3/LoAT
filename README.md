# LoAT -- the Loop Acceleration Tool

LoAT (**Lo**op **A**cceleration **T**ool) is a fully automated tool to analyze *transition systems* and linear *Constrained Horn Clauses (CHCs)* with integer variables.
For transition systems, it supports the inference of **lower bounds** on the worst-case runtime complexity and **non-termination proving**.
For CHCs, it can prove **unsatisfiability**.

For more information, please visit [LoAT's website](https://loat-developers.github.io/LoAT/).
