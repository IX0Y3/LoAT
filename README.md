# LoAT -- the Loop Acceleration Tool

LoAT (**Lo**op **A**cceleration **T**ool, formerly known as **Lo**wer Bounds **A**nalysis **T**ool) is a fully automated tool to analyze programs operating on integers.
Currently, it supports the inference of **lower bounds** on the worst-case runtime complexity and **non-termination proving** (in the branch [nonterm](https://github.com/aprove-developers/LoAT/tree/nonterm)).

LoAT uses a [calculus for modular loop acceleration](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-45190-5_4) and a variation of ranking functions to deduce lower bounds and to prove non-termination.

The tool is based on the recurrence solver [PURRS](http://www.cs.unipr.it/purrs/) and the SMT solvers [Yices](https://yices.csl.sri.com/) and [Z3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3/).

## Input Formats

To analyze programs with LoAT, they need to be represented as *Integer Transition Systems*.
It supports the most common formats for such systems.

### SMTLIB

LoAT can parse the [SMTLIB-format](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SMTPushdownPrograms.pdf) used in the category *Termination of Integer Transition Systems* at the annual [*Termination and Complexity Competition*](http://termination-portal.org/wiki/Termination_Competition).

### KoAT

LoAT also supports an extended version of [KoAT's input format](http://aprove.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/eval/IntegerComplexity/), which is also used in the category *Complexity of Integer Transition Systems* at the annual *Termination and Complexity Competition*.

In this extension, rules can be annotated with polynomial costs:
```
l1(A,B) -{A^2,A^2+B}> Com_2(l2(A,B),l3(A,B)) :|: B >= 0
```
Here, `A^2` and `A^2+B` are lower and upper bounds on the cost of the rule.
The upper bound is ignored by LoAT.
The lower bound has to be non-negative for every model of the transition's guard.

### T2

The branch [nonterm](https://github.com/aprove-developers/LoAT/tree/nonterm) comes with experimental support for the native input format of [T2](https://github.com/mmjb/T2).

## Awards

In 2020, LoAT competed as standalone tool at the [*Termination and Complexity Competition*](http://termination-portal.org/wiki/Termination_Competition) for the first time.

* best tool for proving non-termination in the category *Termination of Integer Transition Systems* at the [*Termination and Complexity Competition 2020*](http://termination-portal.org/wiki/Termination_Competition_2020)
* 2nd place in the category *Termination of Integer Transition Systems* at the [*Termination and Complexity Competition 2020*](http://termination-portal.org/wiki/Termination_Competition_2020)

Since 2016, [AProVE](http://aprove.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/) is using LoAT as backend to prove lower bounds on the runtime complexity of integer transition systems.
In this constellation, AProVE and LoAT won the following awards:

* 1st place in the category *Complexity of Integer Transition Systems* at the [*Termination and Complexity Competition 2016*](https://termcomp.imn.htwk-leipzig.de/competitions/Y2016)
* 1st place in the category *Complexity of Integer Transition Systems* at the *Termination and Complexity Competition 2017* (unfortunately, the results are no longer available online)
* 1st place in the category *Complexity of Integer Transition Systems* at the [*Termination and Complexity Competition 2018*](http://group-mmm.org/termination/competitions/Y2018/)
* 1st place in the category *Complexity of Integer Transition Systems* at the [*Termination and Complexity Competition 2019*](http://group-mmm.org/termination/competitions/Y2019/)

## Build

So far, LoAT has only been tested on Linux.

Unfortunately, building LoAT is rather complex, so please consider using our [pre-compiled releases](https://github.com/aprove-developers/LoAT/releases).
If you need a different version, write an email to ffrohn [at] mpi-inf.mpg.de.

To compile LoAT, you will need the following libraries (and their dependencies, including [CLN](https://www.ginac.de/CLN), [NTL](https://libntl.org), and [Giac](http://www-fourier.ujf-grenoble.fr/~parisse/giac.html)):

* [GiNaC](http://www.ginac.de)
* a custom version of [PURRS](https://github.com/aprove-developers/LoAT-purrs)
* [Z3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3)
* [boost](https://www.boost.org)
* [Yices2](https://yices.csl.sri.com)

To install Z3, download and unpack the latest [Z3 release](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3/releases) and add `/path/to/z3/bin` to your `PATH`.
To install Yices2, you need to install its dependencies [LibPoly](https://github.com/SRI-CSL/libpoly), [CUDD](https://github.com/ivmai/cudd), and [GMP](https://gmplib.org).
After installing all dependencies, run:

```
mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make -j
```

To build a statically linked binary, you need to build a statically linked version of Yices2.
To do so, you need to build position independent versions of LibPoly, CUDD, and GMP (compiled with the option `-fPIC`).
See [here](https://github.com/SRI-CSL/yices2/blob/master/doc/COMPILING) and [here](https://github.com/SRI-CSL/yices2/blob/master/doc/GMP) for detailed instructions.

Once all dependencies are available, run:


```
mkdir build-static && cd build-static && cmake -DSTATIC=1 .. && make -j
```

If you experience any problems, contact ffrohn [at] mpi-inf.mpg.de.
