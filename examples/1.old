Initial Control flow graph problem:
  Start location: a
      0: a -> b : [], cost: 1
      1: b -> b : A'=-1+A, B'=-2+B, [ A>=0 && B>=0 && C>=2*free ], cost: 1

Eliminating 1 self-loops for location b
  Removing the self-loops: 1 2 3.

Accelerated all simple loops using metering functions (where possible):
  Start location: a
      0: a -> b : [], cost: 1
      4: b -> b : A'=-1+A, B'=-2+B, [ A>=0 && B>=0 && C>=2*free ], cost: 1


Chained simpled loops:
  Start location: a
      0: a -> b : [], cost: 1
      5: a -> b : A'=-1+A, B'=-2+B, [ A>=0 && B>=0 && C>=2*free ], cost: 2


Pruned:
  Start location: a
    <empty>


Final control flow graph problem, now checking costs for infinitely many models:
  Start location: a
    <empty>


Computing complexity for remaining 0 transitions.


The final runtime is determined by this resulting transition:
  Final Guard: 
  Final Cost:  1

Obtained the following complexity w.r.t. the length of the input n:
  Complexity class: const
  Complexity value: 0

WORST_CASE(Omega(1),?)
