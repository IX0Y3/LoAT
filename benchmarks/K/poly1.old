Initial Control flow graph problem:
  Start location: start
      0: eval -> eval : A'=1+A, B'=B+A, [ A>=B ], cost: 1
      1: eval -> eval : A'=A-C, B'=B+C^2, C'=-1+C, [ A>=B ], cost: 1
      2: start -> eval : [], cost: 1

Eliminating 2 self-loops for location eval
  Removing the self-loops: 0 1.

Accelerated all simple loops using metering functions (where possible):
  Start location: start
      3: eval -> eval : A'=1+A, B'=B+A, [ A>=B ], cost: 1
      4: eval -> eval : A'=A-C, B'=B+C^2, C'=-1+C, [ A>=B ], cost: 1
      2: start -> eval : [], cost: 1


Chained simpled loops:
  Start location: start
      2: start -> eval : [], cost: 1
      5: start -> eval : A'=1+A, B'=B+A, [ A>=B ], cost: 2
      6: start -> eval : A'=A-C, B'=B+C^2, C'=-1+C, [ A>=B ], cost: 2


Pruned:
  Start location: start
    <empty>


Final control flow graph problem, now checking costs for infinitely many models:
  Start location: start
    <empty>


Computing complexity for remaining 0 transitions.


The final runtime is determined by this resulting transition:
  Final Guard: 
  Final Cost:  1

Obtained the following complexity w.r.t. the length of the input n:
  Complexity class: const
  Complexity value: 0

WORST_CASE(Omega(1),?)
