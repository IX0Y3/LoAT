Initial Control flow graph problem:
  Start location: start
      0: f -> f : [ 0>=1+A^2 ], cost: 1
      1: start -> f : [], cost: 1

Eliminating 1 self-loops for location f
  Self-Loop 0 has unbounded runtime, resulting in the new transition 2.
  Removing the self-loops: 0.

Accelerated all simple loops using metering functions (where possible):
  Start location: start
      2: f -> f : [ 0>=1+A^2 ], cost: INF
      1: start -> f : [], cost: 1


Chained simpled loops:
  Start location: start
      1: start -> f : [], cost: 1


Pruned:
  Start location: start
    <empty>


Final control flow graph problem, now checking costs for infinitely many models:
  Start location: start
    <empty>


Computing complexity for remaining 0 transitions.


The final runtime is determined by this resulting transition:
  Final Guard: 
  Final Cost:  1

Obtained the following complexity w.r.t. the length of the input n:
  Complexity class: const
  Complexity value: 0

WORST_CASE(Omega(1),?)
