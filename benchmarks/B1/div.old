Initial Control flow graph problem:
  Start location: start
      2: div -> div : B'=B-A, [ B>=1+A && A>=1 ], cost: 1
      0: div -> end : [ 0>=A ], cost: 1
      1: div -> end : [ A>=B ], cost: 1
      3: start -> div : [], cost: 1


Simplified the transitions:
  Start location: start
      2: div -> div : B'=B-A, [ B>=1+A && A>=1 ], cost: 1
      3: start -> div : [], cost: 1

Eliminating 1 self-loops for location div
  Removing the self-loops: 2.

Accelerated all simple loops using metering functions (where possible):
  Start location: start
      4: div -> div : B'=B-A, [ B>=1+A && A>=1 ], cost: 1
      3: start -> div : [], cost: 1


Chained simpled loops:
  Start location: start
      3: start -> div : [], cost: 1
      5: start -> div : B'=B-A, [ B>=1+A && A>=1 ], cost: 2


Pruned:
  Start location: start
    <empty>


Final control flow graph problem, now checking costs for infinitely many models:
  Start location: start
    <empty>


Computing complexity for remaining 0 transitions.


The final runtime is determined by this resulting transition:
  Final Guard: 
  Final Cost:  1

Obtained the following complexity w.r.t. the length of the input n:
  Complexity class: const
  Complexity value: 0

WORST_CASE(Omega(1),?)
